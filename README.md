2048
====

Description
-----------
My implementation of 2048 in Java. Made over a couple of nights because I was missing Java.

Inspiration
-----------
The original (which I am yet to crack!):
http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/

Usage
-----
javac G2048.java

java G2048


Structure
---------
1. Game: Contains all game info and dependent methods.
2. GameHelper: Contains game-state-independent methods required by the Game class. Separate class introduced to retain simplicity.
3. G2048: Contains actual game loop.
